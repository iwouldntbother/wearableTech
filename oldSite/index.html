            <p>The Pearl is a small implantable oyster card and tfl guide.<br>
            It's implanted in the hand between the thumb and index finger,<br>
            this can then be used to tap in and out of the London Underground.<br>
            <br>
            The built in LEDs guide the user on what line to take to get to their destination.</p>

            <h1>Why?</h1>
            <p>Crime rates are increasing on the London Underground,<br>
            the most common of which is theft.<br>
            <br>
            Also the amount of passengers daily has been increasing over the last few years,<br>
            this can put new travellers off, especially as its easy to get lost down there!<br>
            <br>
            Thats why The Pearl is implanted, you'd have to lose your hand to not get home!<br>
            It also fatures built in LEDs to guide you on what line to take to get to your destination.</p>

            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>Here at WWSTWD Studios, I started the development of The Pearl roughly 5 years ago.
            It all started with an Arduino, a breadboard and some components in my bedroom at university.
            <br><br>
            All together I went through roughly 100 Oyster cards, I had to use a real card due to legal reasons.
            Then next came packaging that into a small pill-shaped injectable component.
            Once I had that sorted I decided to play around with the idea of it lighting up to show it was being scanned.
            I soon realised this was pointless as the barriers do this.
            I then moved onto the idea of guiding the user with an RGB LED, it can display the colour of the line needed.
            <br><br>
            Next was powering the LED, the Oyster chip runs off power given to it by the barriers, I needed power for the
            LEDs. The Pearl actually has tiny microscopic hairs that draw energy from the surrounding flesh and heat.
            <br><br>
            I have a background in web and app development so I threw together a small web app that could allow me to
            program the journey and test it live!
            The inital tests were rough, the lack of internet on the Underground was an issue initally but I soon moved
            to a location based system. I refined the app and a few years later were here! Hundreds of people are walking
            around with The Pearl in them, helping them get where they need to go, worry free!</p>
